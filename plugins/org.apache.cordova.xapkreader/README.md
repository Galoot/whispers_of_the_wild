phonegap-xapkreader
===================

Cordova plugin to access files in APK Expansion Files for Cordova/Phonegap Android application.

The plugin is an implementation of the process described here : [APK Expansion Files](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)

# Installation

This plugin use the Cordova CLI's plugin command. To install it to your application, simply execute the following (and replace variables).

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/moust/phonegap-xapkreader.git --variable MAIN_VERSION=1 --variable PATCH_VERSION=1 --variable FILE_SIZE=1095520
```

- `MAIN_VERSION` : The main version of your expansion file.
- `PATCH_VERSION` : The patch version of your expansion file.
- `FILE_SIZE` : The byte size of your expansion file. This is used to verify the int√©grity of the file after downloading.

**After installation you need to edit `src/org/apache/cordova/xapkreader/XAPKDownloaderService.java` to put your own application public key.**

Further, you need to add to your application the __Google Play Licensing Library__ and __Google Play APK Expansion Library__ from the *Android Extras* folder using the Android SDK manager (run `android sdk`).

You can find an explanation on how to do this in the following page : [Preparing to use the Downloader Library](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html#Preparing)

## How to referencing to the Licensing Library and APK Expansion Library

1. Start the Android SDK Manager and install **Google Play Licensing Library** and **Google Play APK Expansion Library** in the *Extra* folder if it's not already the case.

2. Create licensing project and build library
```
android update project --path [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_licensing/library --target 1
cd [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_licensing/library
ant release
```

3. Create apk expansion project and build library
```
android update project --path [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/downloader_library --target 1
cd [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/downloader_library
ant release
```

4. Update app project to use apk expansion library
```
android update project --path path/to/your/project \
--library [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/downloader_library \
--library [path/to/your/android/sdk]/extras/google/play_apk_expansion/zip_file
```

5. Edit app `project.properties` and change the path in `android.library.reference.1` and `android.library.reference.2` to use relative path and not absolute as absolute paths fail to work

# Using

The file is returned to a success callback as URL object that you can use like in the example below or with the File API.

```
XAPKReader.get(filename, successCallback, [errorCallback], [fileType]);
```

You may also access your files by using the content provider.

```
<img src="content://org.apache.cordova.xapkreader/image.jpg">
```

## Parameters

- **filename** : The name of the file to load form the expansion file
- **successCallback** : The callback that executes when the file is loaded.
- **errorCallback** (Optional) : The callback that executes if an error occurs.
- **fileType** (Optional) : The file type.

## Example

```javascript
XAPKReader.get(
    'image.jpg',
    function (url) {
        var img = new Image();
        img.src = url;
        document.body.appendChild(img);
    },
    function (error) {
        console.error(error);
    },
    'image/jpeg'
);
```
